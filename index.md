# Welcome 

This page will be a completely khaotic list of tools, articles, and resources I use regularly in Pentesting and CTF situations. My goal is to build this list as often as possible with examples, articles, and useful tips. It will serve as a reference for when I forget things and hopefully will help others to discover tools that they haven't used.
