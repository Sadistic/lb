*Hashcat

Hashcat is a popular and effective password cracker widely used by both penetration 
testers and sysadmins as well as criminals and spies. Cracking passwords is different 
from guessing a web login password, which typically only allows a small number of 
guesses before locking your account. Instead, someone who has gained access to a 
system with encrypted passwords ("hashes") will often try to crack those hashes 
to recover those passwords.

*Metasploit Project

The Metasploit Project is a computer security project that shows the vulnerabilities 
and aids in Penetration Testing. Penetration Testing is an authorized simulated attack 
on computer system looking for security weaknesses, and Instruction Detection System (IDS) 
signature, which on the other hand monitors a network or systems for malicious activities. 
The other most related sub-project is the Metasploit Framework. Metasploit Framework is 
open source and it is the most common exploit development framework in the world.

However, one can utilize it to perform some legitimate and unauthorized accesses and 
activities on computer systems. In this regard, it is no different from any other similar 
commercial products such as Immunityâ€™s Canvas or Core Security Technologies. However, 
Metasploit is commonly used to break into remote systems or test for a computer 
system vulnerability.

This is a test
