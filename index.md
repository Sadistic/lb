# News


S-Society is a new CTF group that I am trying to form I have been involved with pentesting CTF's for about 2 years now
so, I am still a beginner looking for like minded people to continue learning as much as we can. if this sounds like
something you would like to get into then join us on IRC or Discord.

<a href="irc://irc.geekshed.net/S-Society">S-Society IRC</a>
{: discord}

This Is Our World Now... 

the world of the electron and the switch, the
beauty of the baud.  We make use of a service already existing without paying
for what could be dirt-cheap if it wasn't run by profiteering gluttons, and
you call us criminals.  

We explore... and you call us criminals.  We seek
after knowledge... and you call us criminals.  We exist without skin color,
without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.
You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us
and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals.

Yes, I am a criminal.  My crime is that of curiosity.  My crime is
that of judging people by what they say and think, not what they look like.
My crime is that of outsmarting you, something that you will never forgive me for.

We are the rarest common race on earth, we are HACKERS, and this is our manifesto.  You may stop the individual,
but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike, JOIN US!!

# Welcome 

This page will be a completely khaotic list of tools, articles, and resources I use regularly in Pentesting and CTF situations. My goal is to build this list as often as possible with examples, articles, and useful tips. It will serve as a reference for when I forget things and hopefully will help others to discover tools that they haven't used.
