# Welcome

This page will be a completely khaotic list of tools, articles, and resources I use regularly in Pentesting and CTF situations. My goal is to build this list as often as possible with examples, articles, and useful tips. It will serve as a reference for when I forget things and hopefully will help others to discover tools that they haven't used.


# Discord Logo/Banner Design

Aside from this being a place to get info about pentesting this is also a place to get all of your Discord server needs fulfilled 

* Banner
* Server Buttons
* Emojis
* and any other branding you would like

**View [/GFX-Shop](GFX-Shop) to get more info**
